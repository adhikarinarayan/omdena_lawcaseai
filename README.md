##  Enhancing Legal Research and Prediction through AI-Powered Case Law Analysis
---
### Summary of the Project
Omdena and its Los Angeles chapter led a groundbreaking project involving 125 global volunteers to create an advanced legal chatbot focused on Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. Over eight weeks, the team developed a user-friendly tool to empower individuals seeking information about their rights. The chatbot utilizes a hybrid Retrieval Augmented Generation architecture, combining graph and vector databases with Courtlistener's legal case repository for accurate information retrieval. At its core is Law-Chat LLM, a fine-tuned Llama-2-7b model trained on legal cases, enabling comprehension of complex legal terminology. The project successfully demonstrated AI's potential to bridge the justice gap by providing accessible legal information through a web application interface. This initiative showcases the power of collaborative AI development in addressing societal challenges and promoting equity. Future efforts could expand the chatbot's knowledge base, refine its conversational abilities, and incorporate feedback to enhance its accuracy and relevance.
